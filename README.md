## Overview

These are design files for a two channel lead acid battery charger.  It is powered from a DC supply, such as a laptop adapter and is deisgned to charge 12 V, 7 Ah SLA batteries often used in gliders (sailplanes).

The design fits in a Hammond 1591XXS enclosure.  It uses [Silvertel Ag102 battery charger modules] (http://www.silvertel.com/product-support/battery-charger-documentation.html) and has an Atmel ATtiny microcontroller to detect the float charging state.

Refer to [http://www.avon-tech-solutions.co.nz/gliding.html](http://www.avon-tech-solutions.co.nz/gliding.html) for example products using this technology.

## To do

Several files will be uploaded here soon:

1. Cadsoft EAGLE v5.12.0 design files including schematic, pcb, design rules and CAM job
2. PDF of schematic
3. PDF of a possible drilling arrangement for the suggested enclosure
4. BOM / Parts List
